# PORTFOLIO OF MEI NURFATDILAHüë©üèº‚Äçü¶∞
# About me üëãüèº

Hello, my name is Mei Nurfatdilah. Starting in early 2023 I have been learning and practicing to get to be a QA. I am happy to find a place where I can develop myself. I hope in the future I can be someone who professionally maintains the quality of products and services. Since I studied Informatics Engineering in college, software development really interests me, especially in software testing. In the QA position, I see the potential to make a huge impact by delivering good quality of products we have tested to the users. In this portfolio, I would like to share my knowledge of QA and demonstrate the practical skills that I gained through courses and self-study. I am determined to keep growing in this field. I have also just started learning test automation in Javascript using Cypress, so right now my main focus is to advance my knowledge and keep practicing.

# My Experience üèõÔ∏è
Despite having no professional experience in software quality assurance, as a graduate with an educational background in informatics, I have experienced a series of learning journeys that have strengthened my understanding of QA. From conducting black box testing for my final project to engaging in non-functional web testing during my internship. In addition, to further sharpen my skills and knowledge, I also attended a QA assurance bootcamp that provided an in-depth insight into industry best practices and successfully completed the course with the 3rd highest score out of 77 students. With my educational background and experience, I am ready to take on new challenges and contribute to ensuring optimal software quality.
