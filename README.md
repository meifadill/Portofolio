# About me 👋🏼

Hello, my name is Mei Nurfatdilah. Starting in early 2023 I have been learning and practicing to get to be a QA. I am happy to find a place where I can develop myself. I hope in the future I can be someone who professionally maintains the quality of products and services. Since I studied Informatics Engineering in college, software development really interests me, especially in software testing. In the QA position, I see the potential to make a huge impact by delivering good quality of products we have tested to the users. In this portfolio, I would like to share my knowledge of QA and demonstrate the practical skills that I have acquired through courses and self-study. I am determined to keep growing in this field. I have also just started learning test automation in Javascript using Cypress, so right now my main focus is to advance my knowledge and keep practicing.
